MONICA: Look at you, you won't even look at him.
CHANDLER: [sarcastically] Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women wont look at me.

JOEY: I dont know. What are you wearing?
[Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him]
ROSS: Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
PHOEBE: Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
CHANDLER: Pirates again?
PHOEBE: No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop". And they are.
JOEY: Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
CHANDLER: [sarcasticly] Thanks Joey, thats a good idea.
PHOEBE: What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
CHANDLER: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. Its a whole big boob story.
PHOEBE: I could be a secretary.
CHANDLER: Well, you know Phoebs. I dont know if its your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
PHOEBE: I could do that.
[Rosss beeper goes off]
RACHEL: What are you playing with?
ROSS: Oh, its my new beeper.
JOEY: What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
MONICA: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, theyre still extinct.'
ROSS: No, its for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.

MONICA: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belts to tight, gotta change the belt. Did i turn the fish? [goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner] No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
RACHEL: Just a touch. Mon, I dont understand. I mean, youve been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
MONICA: What?
RACHEL: Could tonight be the Night?

[Phoebe and Chandler enters]
JOEY: Hey, hey. How was the first day?
PHOEBE: Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
CHANDLER: See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. [Joey and Ross wonder what he means] Me.
PHOEBE: No, I didnt tell anybody that I knew you.
CHANDLER: Why not?
PHOEBE: Oh, because, you know... they dont like you.
CHANDLER: What?
PHOEBE: I thought you knew that.
CHANDLER: Noho. Why doesnt they like me?
PHOEBE: Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
CHANDLER: What are you talking about?
PHOEBE: Dont feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now youre like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
[Joey and Ross laughs]
CHANDLER: I cant belive it.
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
CHANDLER: They do me?
PHOEBE: You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
[Joey and Ross laughs]
CHANDLER: I dont sound like that.
ROSS: Oh, oh Chandler...
JOEY: Oh... Yeah, you do.
ROSS: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
[Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs]
JOEY: [reaches for hi scones] My scones.
PHOEBE, JOEY & ROSS: 'My scones.'
[Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs again]
CHANDLER: Okay, I dont sound like that. That is so not true.
[Joey and Chandler laughs]
CHANDLER: That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
[Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs]
[Scene: Monica and Rachels apartment. Monica and Ethan are sitting in the couch.]
MONICA: Did not.
ETHAN: I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place wher crimes happen.
MONICA: How was that possible?
ETHAN: Well, think about it. Its always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' You know, I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
MONICA: Okay.
[They kiss]
ETHAN: Okay.
MONICA: Unless--
ETHAN: What?
MONICA: Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, Im going to, so...
ETHAN: Yeah, Id really like that.
[They kiss]
ETHAN: Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
MONICA: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'Im secretly married to a goat'?
ETHAN: Well its somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, Im not uh..., well I, I mean I havent ever uh...
MONICA: Ethan--
ETHAN: Yeah?
MONICA: Are you a virgin?
ETHAN: Well, if thats what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, Ive kinda been waiting for the right person.
MONICA: Really?
ETHAN: Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
[They kiss]
[Time lapse. They are now in Monicas bedroom, on the bed.]
ETHAN: Wow!
MONICA: You keep saying that.
ETHAN: You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practise it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
[They kiss]
MONICA: Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
ETHAN: Oh god, dont tell me, I did it wrong.
MONICA: No no. Nothing wrong about that. 
ETHAN: Oh.
MONICA: Um, okay, here it goes. Im not 22. Im, Im 25... and thirteen months. 
ETHAN: Huh!
MONICA: But I figured, you know, that shouldnt change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
[They kiss]
ETHAN: Uh, listen um, as long as were telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. Im a little younger than I said.
MONICA: Youre not a senior?
ETHAN: Oh, Im a senior... in High School.
MONICA: Ok...ay.
[Time lapse]
MONICA: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had s*x with somebody that wasnt alive during the Bicentennial.
ETHAN: I just had s*x.
MONICA: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
ETHAN: Well, you never told me how old you were.
MONICA: Well, thats different. My lie didnt make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
ETHAN: I wasnt thinking. I was too busy fallin'--
MONICA: Dont say it. [closes Ethans mouth with her hand]
ETHAN: --in love with you.
MONICA: Really?
ETHAN: [nods] Sorry.
MONICA: Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldnt even be here, its a school night. Oh god, oh god. Im like those women that you see with shiny guys like Chad. Im Joan Collins.
ETHAN: Who? 
[Scene: Monica and Rachels apartment. Everyone exept Monica is there.] ROSS: [on phone] Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. [to Phoebe] Just easier that way.
CHANDLER: Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
RACHEL: No, forget it.
CHANDLER: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
RACHEL: All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. [Camera fades to Ross, whos listening very carefully] Joey was there too.
JOEY: All right.
ROSS: Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
RACHEL: No.
ROSS: Youre sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
RACHEL: No, it was just the three of us.
ROSS: Huh!
JOEY: So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
RACHEL: He, he, he. You know what?
JOEY: What?
RACHEL: There were times when it wasnt even me.
[Chandler and Joey laughs, until they look at each other]
PHOEBE: That is so sweet, you guys. [hugs them]
[Monica enters, wearing a walkman, so she doesnt hear what the others say]
ROSS, RACHEL & PHOEBE: Hey, Mon.
RACHEL: Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
ALL: [shouting] Mon!
[Monica takes of her walkman]
MONICA: What?
RACHEL: Ethan called again.
MONICA: Oh.
ROSS: Are you not seeing him anymore?
MONICA: No. You know, sometimes just things doesnt work out.
CHANDLER: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
[Monica stares at Rachel]
RACHEL: I, I didnt say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear.
JOEY: Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest "Power Ranger" is?
[Ross and Chandler laughs]
ROSS: Oh, yeah.
MONICA: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
JOEY, CHANDLER & ROSS: Sorry.
ROSS: Its morphin time!
JOEY: Stegosaurus!
CHANDLER: Tyrannosaurus!



[They all cross theyre arms like the "Power Rangers" do]
PHOEBE: Ooh, oh, Ive gotta go. [raises] Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. [sits down, and then raises again] Cool!
RACHEL: Where are you going?
PHOEBE: Um, oh, Ive got a birthday party, with some work people.
CHANDLER: Work people? Nobody told me.
PHOEBE: No, I know. Thats a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravagance.
CHANDLER: You know, I dont get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because Im in charge doesnt mean im a different person.
PHOEBE: Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
CHANDLER: You think I should?
PHOEBE: I really do, yeah.
CHANDLER: Okay.
PHOEBE: Okay.
CHANDLER: Okay.
PHOEBE: Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I dont wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
[Scene: Chandlers office. He and Phoebe are taking a break from work.]
CHANDLER: I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing "Ebony and Ivory".
PHOEBE: You were great. But they still made fun of you.
CHANDLER: What?
PHOEBE: You know, now youre more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss", "Mr.", you know, "Im one of you, Boss", "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing"
CHANDLER: Then, I dont get it.
PHOEBE: Well, you know what Chandler? I think youve gotta face it. Youre like, the guy in the big office, you know. Youre the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say youre a great boss.
CHANDLER: They do?
PHOEBE: Uh huh. But theyre not your friends anymore.
CHANDLER: I just want to--
PHOEBE: No, but you cant.
CHANDLER: But I just wa--
PHOEBE: Uh uh.
[Scene: Central Perk. Everyone exept Phoebe and Chandler is there. Rosss beeper goes off and everyone exept him react.]

ROSS: Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means shes having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
JOEY: What about Andr?
ROSS: Oh, welll this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
[Ethan enters]
ETHAN: Hey.
MONICA: That was gonna be my opener.
RACHEL: [understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone] Hey, did you guys check out those new handdryers in the bathroom?
ROSS: I thought that was just a rumour.
RACHEL: True story.
JOEY: Theyre here allready?
[Rachel, Ross and Ross go to the bathroom]
ETHAN: All right, look. Ive gotta tell you something. Im not 17. I only said so that youd think I was cute and vunerable. Im actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, Im your congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, were great together. We can talk , we make each other laugh, and the s*x. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
MONICA: It was.
ETHAN: Then, whats the problem?
MONICA: Ethan, its um... its icky.
ETHAN: Icky? Youre actually gonna throw this away because its icky?
MONICA: This isnt easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really--
ETHAN: No, dont say it. [closes Monicas mouth with his hand]
MONICA: --love you.
